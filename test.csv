"s06e23"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Ooooh! Freeze him out."	"Male"
"s06e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"That's right!"	"Male"
"s06e23"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"I like it!"	"Male"
"s06e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Eh? We'll show him!"	"Male"

"s06e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!"	"Female"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do."	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff."	"Female"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is."	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"If the school finds out you're fired."	"Female"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Hmm."	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"She's leaving for three months."	"Female"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"For camp!"	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and..."	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!"	"Female"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her."	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Okay well I think...that's your answer."	"Female"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part."	"Male"
"s06e24"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!"	"Male"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!"	"Female"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Excuse me?"	"Male"

"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Oh. Whew!"	"Male"

"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache."	"Male"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!"	"Female"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"I think that's fair."	"Male"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!"	"Female"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh."	"Male"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm..."	"Female"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"I know."	"Male"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can..."	"Female"
"s06e25"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking."	"Male"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this..."	"Female"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?"	"Male"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Sure, what do you have in mind?"	"Female"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"I think you know."	"Male"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Really? I don't really feel like it."	"Female"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"This is what I want to do."	"Male"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much."	"Female"
"s10e01"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Ooy."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?"	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Dude, are you okay?"	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Totally."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Ross, you don't seem okay."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No!"	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?"	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"Alright."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so.."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"Bye."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!"	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"No, no, it's just that it's getting late..."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I don't even know what that's for."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Yeah, that's probably a good idea."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Yeah. I'll see you in the morning."	"Male"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."	"Female"
"s10e02"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"It doesn't look good, does it?"	"Male"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?"	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I'm still all those things!"	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!"	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I am scrappy."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"It's because I'm scrappy."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I won't know what I would do without you."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah, I guess you're right."	"Female"
"s10e03"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training."	"None"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?"	"Male"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency."	"Male"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"You dropped it off?"	"Female"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Yeah."	"Male"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?"	"Male"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it."	"Male"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"You hand-wrote it?"	"Female"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!"	"Male"
"s10e05"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"	"Female"

"s10e17"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Why not?"	"Male"

"s10e17"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night."	"Female"

"s10e17"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!"	"Female"
"s10e17"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"Hey!"	"Male"
"s10e17"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Hey! What do you have there?"	"Female"
"s10e17"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.."	"Male"

"s07e10"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Our apartment is ready."	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"And that makes you angry because..."	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Because you would rather live here with Joey."	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Where did you get that?"	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that."	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Phoebe?"	"Female"
"s07e10"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Hm?"	"Female"

"s07e13"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"	"Female"
"s07e13"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!"	"None"
"s07e13"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Chandler?"	"Female"
"s07e13"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"I-I'm sorry?"	"None"

"s07e13"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing."	"None"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?"	"Male"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids."	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"What?"	"Male"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids..."	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!"	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop."	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant..."	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!"	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty."	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!"	"Male"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!"	"Female"
"s07e14"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Will you quit hoggin' it!"	"Male"
"s07e15"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well, I feel like a snack!"	"Male"
"s07e15"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are."	"Female"
"s07e15"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage."	"Male"
"s07e15"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"What?!"	"Male"
"s07e15"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories."	"Male"
"s07e15"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots."	"Male"

"s04e09"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!"	"Female"
"s04e09"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van."	"Female"

"s04e10"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn."	"Male"
"s04e10"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!"	"Female"

"s04e11"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Y'know, I never saw that."	"Female"
"s04e11"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Ooh, it was only okay."	"Female"
"s04e11"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!"	"Female"

"s08e15"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat."	"Male"

"s08e17"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"And you couldn't think of anything else?!"	"Male"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!"	"Female"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!"	"Female"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"You can always sell your baby."	"Male"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!"	"Female"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"You lied to me!"	"Male"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, she told me too!"	"Female"
"s08e17"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Chandler has two copies of Annie!"	"Female"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!"	"Female"

"s08e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ewwww!!"	"Female"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So..."	"Female"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ewwww!!"	"Female"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?"	"None"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"It hurts me. It physically hurts me."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Now, off the record, you're not..."	"None"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Your make-up!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"I think face to face."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"I would say that."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Face to face, yeah!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay, here I go."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"All right."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!"	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight."	"Male"
"s08e19"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"...and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Well we...we don't have a garage."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Did I say garage? I meant garbage."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Well Rachel needs help with the baby."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"I do. I really do. I don't know anything."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"I'm-I'm sure that's not true."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"No, not a thing."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"It's frightening."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"That's true. You do have another child."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Yeah."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"With another woman. Have you no control Ross?"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Well then you really don't need me to live with you."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"You're gonna be a great father."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?"	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"I hope you're going somewhere with this."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Really?"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"I'm telling you."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Thank you."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"All right you two, I'm gonna get going."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh."	"Male"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Y'know what? You're-you're right."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Really?"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Uh-huh!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Spiteful?!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up..."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Yeah? I'm proud of me too."	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You should be!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You got it!"	"Female"
"s08e20"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!"	"Female"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?"	"Male"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are."	"Female"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks."	"Male"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?"	"Female"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"An hour."	"Male"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"I can't help you."	"Female"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Phoebe!"	"Male"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange.""	"Female"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Chandler Bing."	"Male"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Bing, what an unusual name."	"Female"
"s08e21"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out."	"Male"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Hey!"	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Hey."	"Male"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Hi!"	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?"	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor."	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked."	"Male"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, "That will open up a can of worms.""	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it."	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"It's sex."	"Male"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Do it!"	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Monica!"	"Male"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!"	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic."	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!"	"Female"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Monica, what is the matter with you?"	"Male"
"s08e22"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today."	"Female"

"s02e03"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."	"Female"
"s02e04"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."	"Female"
