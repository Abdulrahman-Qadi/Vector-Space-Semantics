    "# NLP Assignment 2 (40% of grade): Vector Space Semantics for Similarity between Friends Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be creating a vector representation of a document containing lines spoken by a character in the Friends script data (i.e. from the file `training.csv`), then improving that representation such that each character vector is maximally distinguished from the other character documents. This distinction is measured by how well a simple information retrieval classification method can select documents from validation and test data as belonging to the correct class of document (i.e. deciding which character spoke the lines by measuring the similarity of those character document vectors to those built in training).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the lines are not evenly distributed in terms of frequency, this coursework stipulates you can only use a maximum of the first **300 lines** of each character in the training data `training.csv` to create the training documents and a maximum of the first **30 lines** in the validation and test data (from `val.csv` and `test.csv`). This makes it more challenging, as the number of lines spoken by a character can't be used directly or otherwise as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple vector representation for each character document is done for you to start with in this code, as is the pipeline of similarity-based information retrieval evaluation. You need to improve the character vector representations by pre-processing, feature extraction and transformation techniques, as per Questions 1-6 below, which you need to complete as instructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refer to the material in units 8-9 for conceptual background.**"

Initially, the code in this template achieves a mean rank of **4.0**  and accuracy of **0.3** on the test set and a mean rank of **4.2** and accuracy of **0.1** on the validation set - you should be looking to improve those, particularly getting the mean rank as close to 1 as possible.\n"

There is no need to do a grid search over all configurations from all questions as this will easily make the search unrealistic. E.g. Suppose we need 32, 90, and 4 runs to finish the grid search within questions, a cross-question grid search would need 32x90x4 = 11520 runs!
