"s01e03"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?

"s01e03"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."	"Female"
"s01e03"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."	"Female"

"s01e04"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied."	"None"
"s01e04"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."	"Male"
"s01e04"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there."	"None"

"s01e05"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Yep. Pretty much."	"None"
"s01e05"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."	"Male"
"s01e05"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Huh, I never really noticed."	"None"

"s01e06"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid!

"s01e07"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la..."	"Female"

"s01e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Do you want any help?"	"Male"
"s01e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"You come out there, you're a dead man."	"Male"

"s01e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Joey, what's going on?"	"Female"
"s01e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."	"Male"

"s01e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."	"Male"
"s01e07"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything."	"Female"
"s01e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."	"Female"
"s01e07"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last."	"Female"
"s01e07"	"c20"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...."	"Female"

"s01e07"	"c20"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."	"Male"
"s01e08"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"It was a really beautiful service."	"Female"
"s01e08"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream."	"Female"
"s01e08"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"What?"	"Male"
"s01e08"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."	"Male"
"s01e08"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys."	"Male"
"s01e08"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"You're watching a football game at a funeral?"	"Male"

"s01e08"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"	"Female"

"s01e09"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."	"Female"
"s01e09"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"	"Female"

"s01e11"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"I don't think you mean that."	"Female"
"s01e11"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe."	"Female"
"s01e11"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma."	"Female"

"s01e12"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.

"s01e12"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"	"Female"

"s01e13"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really."	"None"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hold on, you-you knew?"	"Male"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!"	"None"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"	"Male"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby."	"None"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"	"Male"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."	"None"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"I'm...happy...for you?"	"Male"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was."	"None"
"s01e13"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."	"Male"

"s01e13"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"With this ring? No contest."	"Male"
"s01e14"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."	"Female"

"s07e01"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!"	"Female"

"s07e01"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"	"Female"

"s07e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married."	"Male"
"s07e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Do you even understand what off the rack means?!"	"Female"
"s07e02"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?"	"Female"

"s07e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?"	"Male"
"s07e02"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Ah, yeah!"	"Female"
"s07e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."	"Male"
"s07e02"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler."	"Female"

"s07e02"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once."	"Female"

"s07e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Yes, I am!"	"Male"
"s07e02"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Looking up?"	"Male"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?"	"Male"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day."	"Male"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"That's what you think."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?"	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."	"Female"
"s07e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"What was her name?"	"Female"

"s04e02"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough."	"Male"

"s04e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica."	"Female"
"s04e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"What?"	"Female"
"s04e03"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change."	"Female"
"s04e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make."	"Female"

"s04e04"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head."	"Male"
"s04e04"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Come on man, you're not a potato."	"Male"

"s04e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"I think he's stealing from me."	"Female"
"s04e05"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Why?"	"Female"
"s04e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Because he's stealing from me!"	"Female"
"s04e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket."	"Female"

"s04e05"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"What are you doing with those?!"	"Female"
"s04e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice."	"Female"

"s04e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"It's okay. How's the soup?"	"Female"
"s04e05"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Umm."	"Female"

"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"No we..."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Hormones."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"...hormones, yeah."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?"	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?"	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh!"	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that..."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, h-how is this like that?"	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know..."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that..."	"Female"
"s04e22"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Alrighty, here come the water works."	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"Hello?"	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding."	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"We don't have to."	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?"	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"She said what?"	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right."	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right."	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?"	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about."	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married."	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"So what are you saying? It's now or never?"	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No. I'm saying it's now."	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"Or?"	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!"	"Male"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Other_Female"	"It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!"	"Female"
"s04e23"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-"	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!"	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Morning, Ross."	"Male"

"s04e24"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Ahh, whoo-hoo!!"	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Do you think he knew I was here?"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me."	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Oh, hello Rachel."	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Ross said my name. Okay? My name."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"How did you get in here?"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Your sister Joan is crazy."	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Yes, we do. But, we have to change first."	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes."	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"Fifteen minutes."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Okay."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Oh, yay..."	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"Great..."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Hi!"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Hi, so what happened?"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, Ross said my name."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Rachel Green"	"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then..."	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"But my clothes are-ohh!"	"Female"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Wow, you look..."	"Male"

"s04e24"	"c20"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?"	"Male"
"s04e24"	"c20"	"Monica Geller"	"Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!"	"Female"

"s08e02"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"So, what's this about?"	"Male"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater."	"Female"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"No. This is my red sweater."	"Male"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay."	"Female"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"What's going on Rach?"	"Male"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?"	"Female"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together."	"Male"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh, it's just not the right time."	"Female"
"s08e02"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"It is the right time."	"Male"

"s08e05"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away."	"None"
"s08e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay."	"Female"
"s08e05"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Awww, I'll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here."	"None"

"s08e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"How come?"	"Male"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Because I put my head between her legs."	"Female"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"To see her pants?"	"Male"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"They're my pants!"	"Female"

"s08e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!"	"Female"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Here's another plan...No!"	"Male"

"s08e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!"	"Female"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"I fear a jury will see it the same way!"	"Male"

"s08e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"You see that?"	"Male"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Do you see this?"	"Female"
"s08e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!"	"Male"

"s08e08"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"When they're hookers."	"None"

"s08e10"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?"	"Female"

"s08e10"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during."	"Female"
"s08e10"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now."	"None"

"s08e10"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!"	"None"
"s08e10"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"The Police? Here? A reunion?!"	"Female"
"s08e11"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?"	"Male"

"s08e11"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!"	"Male"
"s08e11"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Oh no-no-no!"	"Male"
"s08e11"	"c10"	"Other_Male"	"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y'know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head."	"Male"
"s08e12"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!"	"Female"
"s08e12"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!""	"Male"
"s08e12"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, why didn't you just take a cab?"	"Female"

"s09e12"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"What?"	"Female"
"s09e12"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?"	"Female"
"s09e12"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over."	"Female"

"s09e14"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."	"Female"
"s09e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!"	"Female"
"s09e14"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."	"Female"
"s09e14"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"He's not stoned."	"Female"
"s09e14"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Did he go out for a cigarette?"	"Female"

"s09e14"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"My dear, sweet Rach."	"Female"

"s09e15"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything."	"Male"

"s09e15"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"	"Male"
"s09e15"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Joey, that was formula."	"Female"
"s09e15"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"We gotta get more of that."	"Male"

"s09e16"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married."	"Male"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"That's not how you really feel is it?"	"Female"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage."	"Male"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Seriously? You divorce-o?"	"Female"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry."	"Male"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"It's ok that's how you feel."	"Female"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike."	"Male"

"s09e16"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"The Divorcer, to the rescue!"	"Male"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"It's not cooler."	"Female"
"s09e16"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Yeah I just hurt it."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"uhu uhu, check this out."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"No, come on, you know that's not true."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"You're right. There isn't a decent outlet."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Exactly!!"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"	"Male"
"s09e17"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man..."	"Male"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Can I ask you a question?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Yeah."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"What do you think brought than on?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"A love scene? With who?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Olivia."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"So do you think that my dream means anything?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream..."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"You took the same class twice."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"It was hard! Phoebe: Hey!"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Hi."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Ok, we're still on that."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"I didn't say your songs were not good enough."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Tiny portions?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Well...it's not about quality."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."	"Female"
"s09e19"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"What are people having, the garlic Martini?"	"Female"
"s09e20"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?"	"None"
"s09e20"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"oh yes, God yes!!"	"Male"
"s09e20"	"c09"	"Other_None"	"Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. How could he leave me?!?!"	"None"
"s09e20"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"I... I don't know... you seem lovely."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Phonetically?"	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Ok."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Wow. What does that mean?"	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear"."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?"	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Come on! you..."	"Male"
"s09e21"	"c09"	"Ross Geller"	"No!"	"Male"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Good plan."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Oh! trying on clothes."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Rachel... I heard you guys whispering."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Yeah."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"Wow!"	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Yeah..."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Other_Female"	"You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person."	"Female"
"s09e22"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"I try..."	"Female"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."	"Female"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!"	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention."	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"We can't. We're not pharmacists!"	"Female"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba..."	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Kate Miller?"	"Female"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Kate Miller it is."	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend."	"Female"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"In that case should I make sure it's on real good?"	"Male"
"s09e23"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Thank you."	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"	"Female"

"s09e24"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Do you really find this attractive on him?"	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one."	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Oh, damn it!"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"I sleep with him!"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"Game, point!"	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that."	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"NO, NO, NOOO!"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"And that's how it's done!"	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Best out of three?"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	"That's what I'm thinking."	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Chandler Bing"	"Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?"	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Monica Geller"	"Serve the ball, chump!"	"Female"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Other_Male"	": Serve the ball, chump."	"Male"
"s09e24"	"c09"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back."	"Female"
"s05e01"	"c09"	"Rachel Green"	"Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh."	"Female"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!"	"Female"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."	"Male"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."	"Male"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Do you know anything about women?"	"Female"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"No."	"Male"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"That's all right."	"Female"
"s05e02"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Okay."	"Male"
"s05e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Feeling a little better sweetie?"	"Female"
"s05e03"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up."	"Male"
"s05e03"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Me too."	"Female"
"s05e03"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Hey! I just heard. What's up?"	"Male"
"s05e03"	"c10"	"Other_None"	"Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra..."	"None"
"s05e03"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!"	"Male"
"s05e04"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate."	"Male"
"s05e04"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!"	"Female"
"s05e04"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Ooh, it's not a toy."	"Female"
"s05e04"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!"	"Male"
"s05e04"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!"	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Come where?"	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Okay, but try and get Joey too."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?"	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Hi."	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?"	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back."	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Oh, Ross..."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?"	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?"	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I can't believe this is happening."	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"I know."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I am so sorry."	"Male"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"I know that too."	"Female"
"s05e05"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Uh, Ross?"	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Are you still mad at us?"	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Yep."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song."	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Yeah, we are so sorry."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"You're kinda stepping on the song."	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Whatever you decide, whatever you do."	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!"	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now."	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Yes! Exactly! And that's why..."	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner."	"Female"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?"	"Male"
"s05e06"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!"	"Female"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I'll take sports."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Mine!"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"All right. Uhh, international."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Not even on page 7?"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"What about that circled one?"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"But it's available now! Isn't it?"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Yes, it is."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Hey, let's go look at it!"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Okay, let's go."	"Male"

"s05e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"There we go!"	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"Let's go quicker."	"Male"
"s05e07"	"c10"	"Joey Tribbiani"	"Yeah!"	"Male"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!"	"Male"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Well, I do."	"Female"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!"	"Male"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Phoebe Buffay"	"Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."	"Female"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Ross Geller"	"I can't believe you let George Michael slap you."	"Male"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Chandler Bing"	"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry."	"Male"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about."	"Female"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Monica Geller"	"Yes, it was!"	"Female"
"s05e08"	"c10"	"Rachel Green"	"No, it wasn't. It was actually the..."	"Female"

I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv!
